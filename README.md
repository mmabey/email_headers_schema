# Header Schemas

XML schemas for representing headers for email, MIME, and others.

This project seeks to allow developers of [XML schemas](https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema) to reference
[headers](https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml) from various protocols in their work.
For example, the project that motivated this work is the [Email Forensics XML (EFXML)
project](https://bitbucket.org/jpaglier/efxml), which, in part, defines a schema to represent email headers in such a
way as to be useful in forensic examinations. The EFXML schema defines elements for provenance, type mailbox, and so
forth, but all the header fields are defined here.
